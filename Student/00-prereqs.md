## Introduction

A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox. 

## Description

In this challenge we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

### Personal Workstation

- Install the recommended toolset:
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux
    - Azure CLI
    - git 
    - Visual Studio Code, plus recommended extenstions:
      - Docker Extension
      - Kubernetes Extension
      - Remote SSH Extension
    - Optional but recommended: Lens Kubernetes GUI https://docs.k8slens.dev/v4.1.4/ 
- **NOTE:** You can start the next challenge even if this one is still running by using the Azure Cloud Shell.
- **Tip:** You can complete almost all of the challenges with the Azure Cloud Shell!  But be a good cloud architect and make sure you have experience installing the tools locally.

You need to clone this repo locally (regardless of where you are working):  `git clone https://github.com/larryclaman/akshack`

## Success Criteria

1. You have a bash shell at your disposal (WSL, Mac, Linux or Azure Cloud Shell)
1. Running `az --version` shows the version of your Azure CLI
